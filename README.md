# ShinyPots
Adds a shiny glint to the pots, works in 1.8.9. 

Some of the code (like the rendering values etc.) are taken from the [Hyperium Client](https://github.com/HyperiumClient/Hyperium), which is why
this project also uses the same license.

The [original mod for 1.7](https://github.com/GitFyu/ShinyPots) was made by [Fyu](https://github.com/GitFyu).
